# Dungeon-Master

You are the Boss Monster, the guy in charge, the Head Honcho. You are the Dungeon Master

Your goal is to collect the souls of as many invading heroes as possible.

You want them to keep coming, so don't make it so hard that nobody gets to the end, or they'll stop.
But don't make it TOO easy, or the damn heroes will rob you blind.

The game will generate a random dungeon, and then give you a chance to edit it.  Use the arrow keys to edit, and enter to open your doors. (Heroes will die when they hit walls. Obviously, the walls are covered in spikes, or snakes, or acid, or whatever trap you can imagine.)

I had the idea of building a dungeon for the heroes to invade almost right away, but then I got so wrapped up in playing with AI methods, that the rest kinda fell by the wayside. These guys are powered by a neural network, and I expect them to get smarter as you go. But they start out pretty dumb. 

In the future I'll probably set up something so every playthrough from anywhere improves them, but for now it's only local.
